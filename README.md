# Miles-Thomas-Prework-Study-Guide

## Description

This webpage is a collation of information that I learnt during my studying of the prework for Monash University's coding bootcamp. It relates specifically to four fundamental areas of code that I have begun to learn about. The reason for it being made is that it allows me to have the present information in an easy to place and also acted as a way for me to learn some of the skills associated with it through the creation of the webpage. Due to this, it can serve as both an informative resource and a practical tool.

## Usage

Having a place where information is not just collated but also organised is invaluable as, if I ever find myself in a problem relating to one of the issues covered within it, the solution will be easy to find. An added bonus is that, if I am ever having trouble deciding what to focus on, it can also make suggestions. Through the use of Chrome DevTools, you can access a console with all the the present topics listed and a suggestion for which one you should look at first.
